# Problem 1

```


```{r}
exercise_df = read_csv("./Exercise.csv")
```

```{r}


exercise_df2 = mutate(exercise_df, Group2 = Group) %>% 
  mutate(
    Group = as.factor(Group),
    Group2 = as.factor(Group2),
  )

levels(exercise_df2$Group2) = 
  list(Systolic_POST_intervention = "1", Systolic_POST_control = "0")

levels(exercise_df2$Group) =

a) Perform appropriate tests to assess if the Systolic BP at 6 months is significantly different from the baseline values for each of the groups:
i) Intervention group (5p)

Since we don't know true population variance.  We are going to use paired t-test because we intend to compare scores on two different variables but on the same group. Additionally, we test for the mean of the differences with unknown variance.

$H_0$: the Systolic BP at 6 months is equal to the baseline values for intervention group
$H_1$: the Systolic BP at 6 months is significantly different from the baseline values for intervention group

$\bar{d} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}d_i/n$ = -8.58
$s_d = \sqrt{\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}(d_i-\bar{d})^2/(n-1)}$ = 17.17

$t = \frac{\bar{d}-0}{s_d/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{-8.58 - 0}{17.17/\sqrt{36}}$ = -3

$t_{36-1,0.975}$ = 2.03

Since this t-test is two-sided, |t| = 3 > $t_{36-1,0.975}$ = 2.03.

We can reject $H_0$. We can conclude that the Systolic BP at 6 months is significantly different from the baseline values for intervention group

```{r}
sd(exercise_df2$intervention_difference, na.rm = TRUE)

-8.58/(17.17/6)

qt(0.975,35)
```

ii) Control group (5p)

Since we don't know true population variance.  We are going to use paired t-test because we intend to compare scores on two different variables but on the same group. Additionally, we test for the mean of the differences with unknown variance.

$H_0$: the Systolic BP at 6 months is equal to the baseline values for control group
$H_1$: the Systolic BP at 6 months is significantly different from the baseline values for control group

$\bar{d} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}d_i/n$ = -3.33
$s_d = \sqrt{\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}(d_i-\bar{d})^2/(n-1)}$ = 14.81

$t = \frac{\bar{d}-0}{s_d/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{-3.33 - 0}{14.81/\sqrt{36}}$ = -1.35

$t_{36-1,0.975}$ = 2.03

Since this t-test is two-sided, |t| = 1.35 < $t_{36-1,0.975}$ = 2.03.

We cannot reject $H_0$. We can conclude that the Systolic BP at 6 months is not significantly different from the baseline values for intervention group

```{r}
sd(exercise_df2$control_difference, na.rm = TRUE)

-3.33/(14.81/6)

qt(0.975,35)
```

# Problem 2

a) Generate one random sample of size n=20 from the underlying (null) true distribution. Calculate the test statistic, compare to the critical value and report the conclusion: 1, if you reject 𝐻0 or 0, if you fail to rejected 𝐻0. 

```{r}
random_sample = rnorm(20, mean = 120, sd = 15)
```
